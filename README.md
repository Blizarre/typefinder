# TypeFinder

The end goal of this projec is to provide a nice interface to allow for searching GitHub for java types uses.

For the moment the server is using the Github API to look for releases in java project, index them and then provide a list of all types and files.

It is a toy project for the moment, searching capabilities will be implemented later.
